## 30 second pitch

> A not-quite-casual fast-paced 2d strategy game where you hire and send teams of adventurers into the depths to fight monster, discover riches, then set up excavation pipelines, trade centers, and earn as much gold as you can!

## Overview

Core game looks a lot like Turmoil - a single window containing everything. Perhaps with a bit of scrolling. I think rounds should be a bit longer than turmoil, ~20 minutes instead of ~10 minutes. Above ground there is a fantasy village that grows as you delve. Really it's more of a mining operation, but riches tend to bring people, yadayada. Village could be visualized by a top-down map instead - see https://srekel.itch.io/royal-hold.
